Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software developer who's spent time under the hood and behind the scenesâ€”at the intersection of insurance and auto tech. Iâ€™ve written code that knows your policy better than you do, helped vehicles get smarter one software update at a time, and now I build code-generated data platforms that supercharge scalability and squash knowledge silos.

Iâ€™m passionate about elegant systems, meaningful collaboration, and the occasional well-placed pun in a commit message. Let's build something powerfulâ€”and maybe even funâ€”together.
